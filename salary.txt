When paying salaries to employees, companies generally use a salary structure to ensure fairness and compliance in compensation. It ensure pay parity between employees working in the same role and position. By understanding how employers use such a structure to organise payments, you can find the minimum and maximum earning potential for a specific job role and make better career decisions.
In this article, we describe what a salary structure is, explain how to calculate it, look at its different components and demonstrate how to make one.

What Is A Salary Structure?
It is a payment structure that comprises different components of the total compensation package that a company offers to an employee. The company uses a salary structure to determine how much salary it is required to pay the employee. A salary structure may have pay grades with minimum, middle and maximum salary ranges. An employee's educational qualifications, skills, work experience and job responsibilities, are some of the factors that may determine their pay grade. By understanding the salary structure for a role, employees can find out how much they can potentially earn and negotiate their salaries better.

What Are The Components Of A Salary Structure?
The components of a salary structure help companies to make the right payment to their employees. They may vary for different employers, but some basic ones are as follows:
- Cost to Company (CTC): It is the total amount that the company directly or indirectly spends on an employee as their salary package.
- Basic pay or salary: This is a fixed, taxable amount that is 40-45% of the CTC and forms the base pay before allowances or deductions.
- Gross salary: Salary amount before taxes and any deductions.
- Net salary: Take-home salary after deductions.
- Allowance: Additional payments like DA, HRA, LTA, medical, travel, etc.
- Performance bonus and incentives.
- Employee Provident Fund (EPF).
- Employees' State Insurance Corporation (ESIC).
- Labour welfare fund.
- Professional tax.
- Gratuity.

What Are The Types Of Salary Structures?
1. Top-down salary structure: Add assigned salary components to get gross salary.
2. Bottom-up salary structure: Start with gross salary and break into components.

How Is A Salary Structure Calculated?
